## Notice for pull requests

Please first discuss with us on the issue page about your feature request before implementing the actual pull request, so we can discuss about how to achieve the functionality. If we did not discuss about the detail, it is highly possible that we are not accepting the pull request due to the difficulty of maintenance.

## Change Log

**Please note that**

As the core developers and repository owners, [Andy T. Liu](https://github.com/andi611) and [Shu-wen (Leo) Yang](https://github.com/leo19941227) **never** forced others to contribute to the S3PRL project. Instead, most of the times **people want and ask** to contribute to this proejct. Feel free to ask old contributors to check. We built this project from scratch and developed most of the functions ourselves **since 2019** and received huge amount of stars. There were around 400 stars before we started to develop SUPERB Benchmark. (Not to mention that we also recruited most of the first generation SUPERB team members at National Taiwan University ourselves and led the development of SUPERB and rebuilt the entire downstream evaluation codebase. **No one ever paid us** for building this project which we started ourselves in the hope to help others and we did. There are several papers using our upstream collection function citing the S3PRL github link before SUPERB's existence. For example, the S2VC paper in the `Used by` section below.) Hence people were interested to contribute to our project and develop new functions together. From our perspective, **we were kind enough** to help reviewing PRs and help others build their resume. (We could just refuse them in the beginning.) But later, someone started to question about our ownership on this repository and manipulate the information, just because we allowed others to contribute. This made us **really disappointed**. We hence thought about never allowing new contributions in the future. If any old contributors felt unhappy about the current situation, it is okay to dicuss about removing your previous contributions, and we are happy to help. Our principle is always to give the biggest credit to those who already contributed (especially who fought with us when no one knew S3PRL,) instead of someone wishing to take over the repository by undiscussed and overwhelming PRs after the repository is successful. We still welcome new contributions as long as the development is fully discussed and the new contributors accept our principle above. We are grateful and care about every precious old contributions and refuse to dilute old contributors' credit by accepting lots of new PRs. Please find the names below to know the people who put huge effort on making this project successful.

As a worth-mentioning point, we are not accepting new SUPERB development in the future. There are two major reasons:

- The SUPERB team members changed a lot and rapidly. Andy and Leo are not available to involve every new effort, hence we are afraid to accept undiscussed and unreviewed while huge amount of new implementations. We won't get benefit from helping reviewing these efforts, while people will further question about our ownership and try to take over it, and the new members might not always want to contribute to our project. Hence, there is no benefit to both sides.
- The current S3PRL is getting too large and becoming hard to maintain and keep the dependency small.

Hence, we will do our best in maintaining SUPERB and SUPERB-SG, and we believe it is better to let the new SUPERB members to maintain their own implementation in their own repositories, just like how we started from nothing when developing the first version of SUPERB.
So both sides get proper credit to their own development.

This work was the very start of the S3PRL project which established lots of foundamental modules and coding styles. Feel free to checkout to the oldest commits to explore our legacy codebase!

## Introduction and Usages

This is an open source toolkit called **s3prl**, which stands for **S**elf-**S**upervised **S**peech **P**re-training and **R**epresentation **L**earning.
Self-supervised speech pre-trained models are called **upstream** in this toolkit, and are utilized in various **downstream** tasks.

The toolkit has **three major usages**:

### Pretrain

- Pretrain upstream models, including Mockingjay, Audio ALBERT and TERA.
- Document: [**pretrain/README.md**](./s3prl/pretrain/README.md)

### Upstream

- Easily load most of the existing upstream models with pretrained weights in a unified I/O interface.
- Pretrained models are registered through **torch.hub**, which means you can use these models in your own project by one-line plug-and-play without depending on this toolkit's coding style.
- Document: [**upstream/README.md**](./s3prl/upstream/README.md)

### Downstream

- Utilize upstream models in lots of downstream tasks
- Benchmark upstream models with [**SUPERB Benchmark**](./s3prl/downstream/docs/superb.md)
- Document: [**downstream/README.md**](./s3prl/downstream/README.md)

Below is an **intuitive illustration** on how this toolkit may help you:

## how to using cumstom pretrain model to apply specify downstream task?
Some complete recipes are disply at scripts/
`downstream_task_ic.sh  for IC (intent classfication)`
`downstream_task_st.sh  for ST (speech translation)`

## Installation

1. **Python** >= 3.6
2. Install **sox** on your OS
3. Install s3prl: [Read doc](https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/tutorial/installation.html#) or `pip install -e ".[all]"`
4. (Optional) Some upstream models require special dependencies. If you encounter error with a specific upstream model, you can look into the `README.md` under each `upstream` folder. E.g., `upstream/pase/README.md`

## Development pattern for contributors

1. [Create a personal fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the [main S3PRL repository](https://github.com/andi611/Self-Supervised-Speech-Pretraining-and-Representation-Learning) in GitHub.
2. Make your changes in a named branch different from `master`, e.g. you create a branch `new-awesome-feature`.
3. Contact us if you have any questions during development.
4. [Generate a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) through the Web interface of GitHub.
5. Please verify that your code is free of basic mistakes, we appreciate any contribution!
